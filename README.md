# todos_app

This project was created to showcase a small app that allows the user to track their TODOs. It also allows them to create a new TODO.


### Purpose
The purpose of the app was to display a nice code architecture and my overall preferred tech stack and coding style.

The project integrates a demo API of to TODOs which is limited, therefore all features are quite limited because of the demo API and the demonstration purposes of the project.
